WeBuiltThisCity
===============

RamDev tower defense game

This needs to be playable, or at least presentable by February 22nd.

Multi-Platform
--------------
This game will be able to be ran on android mobile devices, pc's, and the Ouya console. Due to the difficulty of user input, development will not be targetted at mobile. 

There are three seperate launch components, one for each platform of development. These provide a standardized hardware interface with the platforms. The game itself is the project "WeBuiltThisCity," this is where everything not specific to any system will be located.

Resources
---------
All resources (IE graphics or data files) should be saved in the Resources folder using all lower case names. All resources should be referenced through the appropriate methods in the MachineInterface or GraphicsInterface.
